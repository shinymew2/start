## My hugo configuration

Here you can find my current Hugo configuration.

To run this in development, just `git pull` this repository and start it with `hugo server --noHTTPCache --disableFastRender`.

For production, you should build the statis site with `hugo`.

I provided my hugo.yaml with all settings configured as their are on my site, but without the variables specific for me.

There is also an example about-page described by `about.md` in the `content` directory.
